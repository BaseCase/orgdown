# OrgDown for Vim

Org-style folding and some other tricks, but for Markdown files, and in Vim!

A hack day project that probably won't go anywhere.

## Installing

### With Vundle

Add the following line to your .vimrc:

```vim
Bundle 'basecase/orgdown'
```

and then source the file and run `:BundleInstall`.


### Without Vundle

I dunno. Prolly have to flesh this section out later.
